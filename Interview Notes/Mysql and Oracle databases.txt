SQL Sub Languages in every database:

1) Data Definition Language (DDL): These commands are used to define structure of the table
==> Create: to create table.
==> Alter: ADD, MODIFY(changes datatype), Drop(drops column)
==> Drop: will drop table from database.
==> Truncate: will delete all data from table.
==> Rename(oracle 9i)

2) Data Manipulation Language (DML):
==> Insert
==> update
==> delete
==> merge(oracle 9i)

3) Data Retrieval Language(DRL) or Data Query Language(DQL):
==> SELECT
1. Arthematic operator(+,-,*,/)
2. Relational operator(=,<,<=,>,>=,[<> or!=]not equal).
3. Logical operator (AND,OR,NOT)
4. Special operator
    1) ‘In’ opposite ‘not in’
    2) ‘between’ opposite ‘not between’
    3) ‘is null’ opposite ‘is not null’
    4) ‘like’ opposite ‘not like’:  % -> group of characters if want to match or string
                                    _ -> single character to match.


4) Transactional Control Language (TCL):
==> Commit
==> Rollback
==> Savepoint

5) Data Control Language(DCL):
==> Grant
==> Revoke


Functions: are used to solve particular task and also functions must return a
value. Oracle have two types of functions.

GROUP FUNCTION (OR) AGGREGATE FUNCTION:
1. max()
2. min()
3. avg()
4. sum()
5. count(*)
6. count(column name)
7. GROUP BY:
8. ORDER BY: This clause is used to arrange the data in sorting order along with “order by” clause we are using two keywords.
HAVING Clause: In all databse systems after “group by” clause we are not allowed to use “where” clause. so use Having clause.


JOINS: 

INNER JOIN: 
LEFT OUTER JOIN:
RIGHT OUTER JOIN:
FULL OUTER JOIN:

constraint: Constraints are used to prevents or stops invalid data entry into our tables.

1) NOT NULL: This constraint doesn’t accepts null values
2) UNIQUE: This constraint doesn’t accepts duplicate values. But it will accepts null values.
3) Primary key:  Primary key "Uniquely identifying a record in a table. There can be only one primary key in a table and also primary key doesn’t accepts duplicate null values
4) Foreign Key: If we want to establishes relationship between tables then we are using “Referential Integrity Constraints” (Foreign Key).
NOTE:   
    ==> One table foreign key must belongs to another table “primary key”.
    ==> primary key doesn’t accepts duplicate, null, values where as foreign key accepts duplicate, null values.

while establishining relationship
1) Deletion in Parent table.
2) Insertion in Child table.

use following clause on child table.

1) on delete cascade: when we will delete parent table record, it will delete its child also.
2) on delete set null: when we will delete parent table record. it will set NULL foreign key in child.

VIEWS:
    ==> VIEW is same as table. 
    ==> Generally, views are created by “Database Administrator”

Transactions:
    ==> commit: when you delete record it can be rollbacked until not commited.
    ==> rollback: when you delete row. you can rollback. 
    ==> savepoint: A SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction when you can roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction.
    ==> release savepoint savepoint(RELEASE SAVEPOINT SAVEPOINT_NAME): it will delete savepoints.

Indexes in Mysql:
    ==> The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
    ==> Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise.

Different Entity states in JPA and Hibernate:

1) New (Transient) state:  The data of objects in this state is not stored in the database.
2) Persistent (JPA managed) stat: The object changes will be auto migrated at tx.commit()
3) deattached: Once tx.commit() is executed, the object becomes detached.
